What do you think are the pros and cons
of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, 
like Google Docs does?

Pros : its easier to see what changed in file.
Cons : you could easily forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file
separately?

Because Git oriented on code, which suppose that we need to track
 file. On other hand Google Docs oriented on documents.
 When we have something like novel in Docs and we want to track changes
  across all chapters - we just should to make in in one file - so docs 
  don't need to be treat seperately. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to try commiting changes.
